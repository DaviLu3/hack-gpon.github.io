A TTL UART adapter makes it possible to connect the stick's serial to a computer via a USB interface, and on the computer through serial emulation it is possible to send commands just like the serial ports of the 1990s

Is widely used in the modding of SFPs, and in general of most embedded devices, since a serial port is always present in all of them and is also used to de-briking the devices.

TTL adapters are widely found on amazon, the most recommended one being:

Alternatively, an [Arduino can be used to emulate a TTL adapter](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/PatelDarshil/ways-to-use-arduino-as-usb-to-ttl-converter-475533)
